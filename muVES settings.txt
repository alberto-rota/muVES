PIXELD DENSITY
-[POSITIVE REAL INTEGER] The spatial resolution in micrometers per pixel. 
 The 2D analysis ignores the Z parameter

DOWNSAMPLING FACTOR
-[POSITIVE INTEGER SCALAR] The number of voxels in the 3D matrix gets reduced of a factor
 2^downfactor, keeping 1-every-downfactor voxels in each dimensions.
 'downfactor = 1' keeps the matrix unaltered, 'downfactor = 2' keeps 1
 voxel every 2.
 <INCREASE for PERFORMANCE, DECREASE for ACCURACY>

SMOOTHING REPETITIONS
-[POSITIVE INTEGER SCALAR] indicates how many consecutive times a smoothing
 operation is performed on the binary matrix.
 The higher this value is, the more times the matrix is ​​"refined", making it
 clearer and decreasing the skeletonization errors; at the same time some
 information is lost(especially on thin vessels)

RADIUS PRECISION
-[POSITIVE INTEGER SCALAR] is the number of equally spaced sections obtained on
 each branch for the calculation of the radius and lateral area
 <INCREASE for ACCURACY, DECREASE for PERFORMACE>

PRINT PTS FILES
-[LOGICAL SCALAR] True prints the .pts file, False does not print it

POINTS PER BRANCH
-[INTEGER] is the number of voxels in eanch branch in
 the skeleton provided to the CFD simulation

EDGE BORDER
-[FLOAT from 0 to 1] is ratio between the edge width and the
 total width of the image. 'edge_border = 0.05' means that 5% of the total
 width is considered edge (used to apply the boundary conditions)

LENGTH THRESHOLD
-[POSITIVE REAL SCALAR] is the minimum length for a branch to be kept in the skeleton

APPEND TO PATH
-[STRING] specifies a string to be appended to the .mat with the results. If nothing 
 needs to be appended leave empty
